What did I work on yesterday?
Yesterday was Saturday, my one day off where I try to do absolutely nothing related to academics. And I succeeded! I cleaned my room and drawers, freed up memory on my phone 
by deleting duplicate photos, and played a decent amount of video games.

What am I working on today?
Today, I intend on finishing this lab, taking photos for my photography class, and do some CSE 101 lecture catching up.

What issues are blocking me?
My will to do academics is making it very difficult for me concentrate and get work done. Feeling the burnout.
